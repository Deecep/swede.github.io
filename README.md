TODO 1: 

- Update this file with a title, a small description of the project.
- Add a section for developers to explain how to get it running on their computer, imagine they just clone the repo, how do they get it running? Eg they will need Firbase Tools, which they can install globally with `npm install -g firebase-tools`, then how do they run it locally?
